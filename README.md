Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your PC.

Compilation Steps:

--Save the Java File:
Save your Java source code file to a specific folder on your PC.

--Open Terminal/Command Prompt:
Open your terminal or command prompt on your computer.

--Navigate to the Directory:
Use the cd command to change the directory to where the Java file is stored. For example:
cd /path/to/your/java/file/directory

Replace /path/to/your/java/file/directory with the actual path to the directory where your Java file is located.

--Compile the Program:
Use the javac command to compile your Java program. Specify the file name with the .java extension. For example:
javac YourFileName.java
Replace YourFileName with the actual name of your Java file.

--Running the Program:

Ensure the Input File is in the Same Directory (Optional):
If the file you want to process with your Java program is in the same directory as your Java file, you don't need to specify the file path in the command.

Run the Program:
Use the java command to run your compiled Java program. Specify the file name without the .java extension and, if necessary, provide the file path of the input file. For example:
java YourFileName /path/to/input/file.txt

Replace YourFileName with your Java file's name and /path/to/input/file.txt with the actual path to the input file you want to process.
